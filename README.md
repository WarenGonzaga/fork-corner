## Installation

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fork-corner):

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD014 -->

```bash
$ npm i fork-corner --save
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD014 -->

or add it directly to your webpage using a CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fork-corner/dist/fork-corner.min.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fork-corner/dist/fork-corner.min.js" defer></script>
```

## Usage

After installing Fork Corner simply add this one line of code to the ``<body>`` of your webpage:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/user/repo" target="_blank" id="fork-corner" class="fork-corner fc-pos-tr fc-animate-default fc-theme-default"></a>
```

Fork Corner uses _``fork-corner``_ as ID to identify which element should be use in creating the fork corner. The class _``fork-corner``_ is use to identify which element to be controlled by the class. We have few important classes to quickly customize the fork corner's look and feel.

### Position Class

Class to position the Fork Corner on your webpage. By default, the position is _``top right``_.

| Class | Position |
|-------|----------|
| ``fc-pos-tr`` | Top, Right |
| ``fc-pos-tl`` | Top, Left |
| ``fc-pos-br`` | Not yet available |
| ``fc-pos-bl`` | Not yet available |

### Animation Class

Class to animate the Fork Corner on your webpage. By default, when you hover your mouse to the icon it will rotate.

| Class | Animation |
|-------|-----------|
| ``fc-animate-default`` | Icon rotation on cursor hover |
